# qb-phone-with-gps-
I Added a small tweak to the qb-phone for server creators who's blips happen to go over the max amount of 99 and it begins to bug their map out.  With this you can go into the config and add blips to your phone that aren't necessary on your map

To add a new blip into the phone, open up the config file, under the Config.Google Maps, change the name of the blip and the vector 3 to your choosing.
